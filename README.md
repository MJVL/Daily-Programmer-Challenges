# Programming-Challenges
This repo contains my solutions for r/dailyprogrammer and ASCL challenges.

### ASCL Warning
I completed some of these challenges for a contest that had number of lines as a judging criteria. Because of this some of these solutions are pretty unreadable/inefficient and break some good coding conventions.
